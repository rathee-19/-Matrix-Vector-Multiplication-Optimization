    "# Performance Optimization Analysis\n",
    "This Repo provides an analysis of the performance results obtained from different scenarios of code optimization and parallelization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance without compiler optimization (-O0)\n",
    "Average Time taken over 10 runs: 0.002858 seconds\n",
    "Average GFLOPS over 10 runs: 0.6998\n",
    "## Reasoning:\n",
    "Without compiler optimization, the code is compiled with minimal optimizations. This leads to slower execution times and lower GFLOPS due to inefficient code generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance with compiler optimization -O1\n",
    "Average Time taken over 10 runs: 0.000958 seconds\n",
    "Average GFLOPS over 10 runs: 2.0887\n",
    "## Performance with compiler optimization -O2\n",
    "Average Time taken over 10 runs: 0.00095 seconds\n",
    "Average GFLOPS over 10 runs: 2.1079\n",
    "## Performance with compiler optimization -O3\n",
    "Average Time taken over 10 runs: 0.0008936 seconds\n",
    "Average GFLOPS over 10 runs: 2.2396\n",
    "## Reasoning:\n",
    "Compiler optimizations at different levels (-O1, -O2, -O3) progressively improve code performance by enabling various optimization techniques such as loop optimizations, inline functions, and instruction scheduling. As optimization level increases, the compiler applies more aggressive optimizations resulting in faster execution and higher GFLOPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance with compiler flags optimization\n",
    "Average Time taken over 10 runs: 0.0008989 seconds\n",
    "Average GFLOPS over 10 runs: 2.2328\n",
    "Flags Used: gcc -O3 -funroll-loops -ftree-vectorize -march=native -fno-strict-aliasing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reasoning:\n",
    "Additional compiler flags such as loop unrolling (-funroll-loops), vectorization (-ftree-vectorize), and architecture-specific optimizations (-march=native) further enhance code performance. These optimizations exploit parallelism and reduce loop overhead, leading to improved GFLOPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance with manual code vectorization using intrinsics\n",
    "Average Time taken over 10 runs: 0.0006055 seconds\n",
    "Average GFLOPS over 10 runs: 3.3077\n",
    "## Reasoning:\n",
    "Manual code vectorization using SIMD intrinsics allows direct access to CPU-specific instructions (e.g., AVX, SSE) for parallel processing. This optimization technique significantly improves performance by leveraging SIMD capabilities, resulting in higher GFLOPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance with only parallelization using OpenMP\n",
    "Average Time taken over 10 runs: 0.0008265 seconds\n",
    "Average GFLOPS over 10 runs: 2.4361\n",
    "## Reasoning:\n",
    "OpenMP parallelization distributes workload across multiple threads, utilizing multicore processors for concurrent execution. While it improves performance compared to non-parallelized code, it may not fully exploit SIMD capabilities for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance with vectorization and OpenMP\n",
    "Average Time taken over 10 runs: 0.0013383 seconds\n",
    "Average GFLOPS over 10 runs: 2.2512\n",
    "## Reasoning:\n",
    "Combining manual code vectorization using intrinsics with OpenMP parallelization aims to leverage both SIMD optimizations and multicore parallelism. However, improper synchronization or overhead from parallelization can sometimes offset the gains from vectorization, resulting in slightly reduced GFLOPS compared to manual vectorization alone.\n",
